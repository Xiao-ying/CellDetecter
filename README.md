# CellDetecter

This software is primarily coded in MATLAB and serves the purpose of aiding in cell detection while also offering visualizations for the detected cells and their tracking results. The original MATLAB code has been encapsulated within both a MATLAB App and a web application to enhance usability. To utilize these tools, two inputs are necessary: firstly, you'll need to designate the folder containing your time-lapse cell images (in .tif format); secondly, you should input the quantity of cells you wish to analyze. For research purposes, this software is made available to the public under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license through our GitHub repository.

However, it's worth noting that the tracking results displayed in the summary sheet do not consistently provide highly accurate cell tracking over time. 
These tracking errors are readily identifiable through the visualizations generated by the software.
