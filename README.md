# CellDetecter
There are two variants of cell detection software: the MATLAB APP version and the web version. This software is primarily coded in 
MATLAB and serves the purpose of aiding in cell detection while also offering visualizations for the detected cells and their tracking results.

However, it's worth noting that the tracking results displayed in the summary sheet do not consistently provide highly accurate cell tracking over time. 
These tracking errors are readily identifiable through the visualizations generated by the software.
